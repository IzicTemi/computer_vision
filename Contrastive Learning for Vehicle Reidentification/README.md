# Image Retrieval using Siamese Networks

I've used a Siamese network with a contrastive loss function to learn embeddings for image retrieval tasks.

## 2.1 Dataset Preparation

I've prepared a dataset by creating pairs of images. Each pair contains two images: one is the anchor image, and the other is either a positive image (same class as the anchor) or a negative image (different class from the anchor). 

## 2.2 Model Architecture

The Siamese network consists of twin networks that share the same weights. Each twin network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes an input image and outputs a feature vector.

## 2.3 Training the Model

**Loss Function**

I've used the contrastive loss function to train the Siamese network. This loss function encourages the model to output similar feature vectors for pairs of images from the same class and dissimilar feature vectors for pairs of images from different classes.

## 2.4 Results

The trained Siamese network can effectively distinguish between similar and dissimilar images, making it suitable for image retrieval tasks.

# 3. Conclusion

The notebook demonstrates the use of fully convolutional networks for image denoising and Siamese networks for image retrieval. Both models achieve good performance on their respective tasks, with detailed evaluation metrics and visual inspection of results provided.
